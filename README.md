#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project  
**This repository contains the R script and documentation for the Coursera Data Science Track course Getting & Cleaning Data**  

##Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  
  
##Details
- Tidy data file is [tidydata.txt]   

1. Here is the Raw data URL:  
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

2. Below is URL for Raw Dataset description:  
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  

##Assignmet Goals
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
